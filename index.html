                    I'm currently majoring in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

                    <p class = "description" id = "about-me">
                        I'm an 18-year-old with a passion for programming, learning new skills, and meeting new people. I started coding
                        in grade 11, when I took the Computer Science course offered by my high school. Ever since then, I've 
                        become interested in creating websites and applications to help make people's lives easier. During the last
                        several years, I've learned Java, C, HTML, and CSS. I'm excited to learn much more more and delve
                        deeper into the field of software engineering and computer science.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p class = "description" id = "education">
                        I'm currently studying at the University of Waterloo for a degree in Honours Software Engineering. I'm
                        currently enrolled in the co-op programming, meaning that I alternate between work and school terms
                        every 4 months. I will be graduating in June 2026 with a Bachelor of Software Engineering.

                        I graduated from Abbey Park High School in June 2021. I had the honour of receiving the 
                        Governor Generalâ€™s Bronze Medal Academic Award, meaning that I had the highest grade average among the graduating 
                        class of that year.
